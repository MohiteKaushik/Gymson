Gymson
A computer-vision-based fitness tracker that makes home workouts engaging through real-time feedback and humor.

🎯 Core Concept This project gamifies the home workout experience. Instead of a boring timer, it uses AI to track your actual movements, ensuring you complete full reps while keeping morale high with meme-based rewards and audio cues.

✨ Key Features Live Body Tracking: Powered by MediaPipe, the app detects body pose in real-time to count reps accurately (currently supports Pushups and Squats).

Instant Form Feedback: correct your posture instantly based on live vector analysis.

Gamified Motivation: Uses meme references and dynamic sound effects to break the monotony of exercise.

Privacy-First: All computer vision processing happens on-device. No video feed is ever stored or sent to the cloud.

🚧 Project Status Current State: Under active development (Alpha).

Implemented: Basic Pushup/Squat detection, MediaPipe integration, meme audio triggers.

Upcoming: Additional exercises, user progress dashboard, and advanced form correction.
